# Description
This is the frontend of the brand that I am a co-founder of called 'Mary Lake Ski Club'. This idea was thought of many years ago and while on my co-op term I had the oppertunity to build a website. Having never done that before I jumped at the oppertunity and taught myself javascript and the vue framework. I made this project after my one at work was funushed and decided to use the same vue framework but use typescript insted.

# Next Steps
Eventually I would like to publish this to the web and connect a backend for payment and start to sell the products. I also want to look into third party services such as shopify becuase they may be more secure and trusted by customers.

# Authour
The sole creater of this project is Bradley Schaefer.

# To run the base project

`cd frontend`
`npm install`
`npm run dev`

Then follow promp and the website will be at 
  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:8080/
  ➜  Network: http://10.0.0.139:8080/
  
# Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 and TypeScript in Vite. The template uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs, check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more.

## Recommended IDE Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

## Type Support For `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

If the standalone TypeScript plugin doesn't feel fast enough to you, Volar has also implemented a [Take Over Mode](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471#discussioncomment-1361669) that is more performant. You can enable it by the following steps:

1. Disable the built-in TypeScript Extension
   1. Run `Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions` from VSCode's command palette
   2. Find `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features`, right click and select `Disable (Workspace)`
2. Reload the VSCode window by running `Developer: Reload Window` from the command palette.
